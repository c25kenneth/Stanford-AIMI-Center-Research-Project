# Stanford-AIMI-Center-Research-Project

Team D's implementation of a NLP model to extract endotracheal tube distances from written radiology reports. 
The extracted distances were then paired with 12,000+ X-ray images to classify tube distances from the carina via a Pytorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The code is currently private, but if more information is needed, please email c25kenneth@gmail.com
